                    <p>We created therapist.co.uk to solve problems of finding a suitable therapist. We started with online appointment-booking – and we haven’t stopped building since. With therapist.co.uk you can see therapist’s specialities, appointment times, competitive prices, book instantly online, and make informed choices with verified reviews.
